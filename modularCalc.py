'''Create a program that will act as a calculator.
It should be able to take two values from the keyboard,
accept the operations to be performed, and return the computed
average.
We will start simple here, assuming the user just enters two integers
and will just request either addition, subtraction, division, or multiplicaiton.
'''
THANK_YOU_MESSAGE = '''Thank you for using our calculator'''

WELCOME_MESSAGE = '''''Thank you for using our calculator -
You will now be prompted to enter an equation to solve it.
It should be entered on a single line in the format "a+b"
Please be sure you leave at least one space between the operands and
the operators.
We have also added additional functionality to the calculators.
You now have the following operations available: \n
    "+" addition
    "-" subtraction
    "/" division
    "//" integer division - also called floor division in python
    "%" modulo
    "a **b" (take the first operand to the power of the second operand)
